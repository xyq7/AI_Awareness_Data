## Overview
Recent advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) are reshaping the labor market. 
Existing research has primarily focused on the objective likelihood of AI-driven occupation
replacement and its potential societal impacts. 
However, individuals’ awareness of job replacement by AI also influences their preparedness, leading to long-term societal effects.
This study investigates the disparities in awareness of AI-driven occupation replacement across 
different racial/ethnic and educational groups.
We conduct an online survey in November 2023 (n=4816) to analyze people’s subjective assessment of being replaced by AI and thereby calculate the group-level correlation with objective assessments as an indicator of awareness.
Our findings reveal that traditionally underrepresented racial/ethnic groups and those with lower educational attainment are less aware of AI’s potential to replace jobs, which may further exacerbate long-term inequalities. Interventions to improve public awareness of AI could enhance preparedness and help ameliorate these disparities.
